# Arc-of-Hanover-WebApp
The Arc of Hanover Web App is the home to events and volunteering opportunities
at the Arc of Hanover.

The app allows creation of three different types of events:
        1. Volunteer-only events
        2. Participate-only events
        3. Volunteer or participate events

Each event has a name, date, and description, and stores lists of participants and volunteers.

In order to create events, a user must first sign up for an account. The default user role only
allows users to sign up to volunteer or to RSVP to attend the event. To create events, a user must
have the role of Organizer. An event organizer has the ability to create, edit, and delete events
they organize.

To create an account, cilck 'Sign Up' on the navigation bar at the top of the app page. Then, enter
your first and last name. Then click 'Create Account.' The system will give you a 5-digit login code
you can use to access your account. The app will redirect you to the login page where you can use your
code to log in to your account.

Upon logging in, the app's home page will display, showing all of the upcoming events. Clicking on 
the name of an event will load the Event Details page, which shows further details about the event.
