# Arc Volunteer App 

The Arc of Hanover Web App (AVA) is the home to events and volunteering opportunities
at the Arc of Hanover.

### Accessing the App

To load AVA, access [this link](https://5rx882vd-4000.use.devtunnels.ms/).

### Signing up for Events

To sign up for an event, click on of the action buttons in event card
There are two options:
- Sign up to Volunteer
- RSVP to attend

When  you cilck one of the buttons, one of two things will happen: if you are not logged in, you will be redirected to a form that asks you for basic information about yourself, nothign too personal. If you are logged in, however, the application will use your account information as input to the form and add you to the list of volunteers or attendees, depending on which button you clicked.


### Account Creation

Signing up for an account is simple. All you have to do is click the `Sign up` button in the top right corner and fill out the form with the basic information, as mentioned above:
- First and Last Name
- Email
- Gender
- Your home address
- Whether you are affected by I/DD(s)
- And if you would like to be a volunteer:
    - Whether you have completed a background check
    - If not, whether you are open to it
    - Whether you have completed a volunteer application

Once you have filled out all required fields, you can click submit and the application will generate a 5-digit code you will use to access your account. You will be redirected to the login page. Enter your login code and voil√†, you are logged into your account. You will be redirected to the main dashboard you saw when you first loaded the site.

### Now that you're in...

##### User Participation Breakdown
On the left side of the page, you will now be able to see a breakdown of your event participation. It displays how many events you have organized (if you have `organizer` permissions), volunteered at, and attended. Below that panel, your upcoming events are displayed, broken down by Events Attending and Events Volunteering.

##### User Dashboard
Logged in users are also given access to their own user dashboard, which shows a list of upcoming events, broken down by category, and past events, also broken down by category.

##### Update your profile
And lastly, don't worry, you can edit your account info at any time simply by clicking on your name in the navigation bar, where the same form you filled out when you signed up will appear, pre-filled with your account details.

### Event Creation

In order to create events, a user must first sign up for an account or log in. The default user role only allows users to sign up to volunteer or to RSVP to attend the event. To create events, a user must have the role of `Organizer` or higher (Manager or Admin). An event organizer has the ability to create, edit, and delete events they organize.

To create an event, click the `Create Event` button at the center of the navigation bar. You will be redirected to a form where you will input the following event information:
- Event Name
- Date
- Location (Street Address)
- Organizer (so if you need to designate a different organizer than yourself, you can)
- Event Type (Same 3 as listed above)
    - Volunteer-only events
    - Participate-only events
    - Volunteer or participate events
- Voolunteering Type:
    - Community Event
    - Thrift Store
- Description (recommended)

After filling out the required fields, you can click submit and you will be redirected back to the page you were previously on. Regardless, the event, given the date is at the earliest today, will show up on the main dashboard feed. And don't worry you can go back and edit your event at any time! (Hopefully before it happens!).
